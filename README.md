# Predictive-Modelling-Competition

The goal of this project is to predict the number of unique objects sold in a shop over a period of 1 month using about 3 yearsâ€™ worth of data. 
Given that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month, we create a robust model capable of handling these situations.
We preprocess the data to handle data noise and engineer some feature to train the models.
We then create two models: a multiple linear regression model and a Random Forest model. 
We train the models and evaluate the models performance based on the rmse.
